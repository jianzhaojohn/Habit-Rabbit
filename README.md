## User story:
* As a user, I can download this app on my android device to keep track of habits that I wish to make/break, and hold myself accountable.
* I can enter habits into the app and have them repeat at custom intervals, and edit them later if I want to change the frequency, or delete them altogether eventually. 
* I can view what I need to do for the day in a visually layout. 
	* appealing agenda layout
	* a diagram
* I want to be stimulated by my Habit Rabbit.
	* Habit Rabbit will guilt me into keeping to my habits by accusing me of "murdering" my virtual rabbits if I do not do what I promised I would.


## Project Description:

* create/login

### How to use our app

when you first open up our app, you will see the login page pops up. you have 2 opetions here: first login with your existing account. second, creating an account. To create a account you simplly click on the register button and this will lead you to the registration page. there is 2 limits on creating account: for user name it must contain "@" and for passwords it has to have at least 4 characters.
After you done with register you can back to login page and login there. When you login, you will see our main page which contain only one rabit house. you can go to another page using the "hunberger" button ont he top left and top right.

In habit page, you can add and create new habit (just click on the button on the buttom right) and in the Agenda page you can see all your habit in a list view. Those data is update whenever you open you app (we update them through our database). 

you can check the habit when you finish them and we will record how you did in a period and display them in a graph view (just click on the habit in habit page for detail). this give user a clearly view how they do in past to build up their habits.

Lastly, our notification works when you open the app and only when you open the app (we are thinking to make it run in background, but not sure if that is too "expensive" in resource for our app. So still thinking).
