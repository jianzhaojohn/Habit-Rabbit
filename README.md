## User story:
* As a user, I can download this app on my android device to keep track of habits that I wish to make/break, and hold myself accountable.
* I can enter habits into the app and have them repeat at custom intervals, and edit them later if I want to change the frequency, or delete them altogether eventually. 
* I can view what I need to do for the day in a visually layout. 
	* appealing agenda layout
	* a diagram
* I want to be stimulated by my Habit Rabbit.
	* Habit Rabbit will guilt me into keeping to my habits by accusing me of "murdering" my virtual rabbits if I do not do what I promised I would.


## Project Description:

### Minimal Viable Product
Users will be able to 
* create/login
* input, remove and edit habits
* view habits in an agenda layout
* view Rabbit Hutch, which is filled with rabbits as you complete a habit, but kills the rabbits when you don’t (and notifies the user that they murdered their rabbits)
    
### Add-on features
* sync with other apps to be kept accountable (such as Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, etc)
* push selected habits to google calendar
* add “friends” who will be able to shame them when they falsely enter that they did something that they didn’t
* bet money,using paypal, that they will complete all their habits for a given period of time. If they fail, the money is donated to a charity of their choice.
